## Forest Fires on Andros, The Bahamas
**Presented at UMBC's Summer Undergraduate Research Fest (August 7th, 2019)**
<br><br>
Worked with the Omland lab and UMBC's biology department to present data and analysis on forest fires on Andros, The Bahamas.
<br>
Compared the relative structures of forest understories in relation to how recent or intense they most recently burned.
<br>
Used remote sensing data to derive a kernel density of forest fire locations up to May 2019.
<br>
Plotted the trend of fire frequency across various months of the year and compared this to annual trends in North Atlantic Oscillation and
local precipitation.
<br>
Made with QGIS and Microsoft Excel using with data from [NASA FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/#z:10;c:-77.9,24.8;t:adv-points;d:2019-04-01..2019-05-01;l:firms_noaa20-viirs,firms_viirs,firms_modis_a,firms_modis_t), NOAA daily weather reports, and NOAA North Atlantic Oscillation values.
