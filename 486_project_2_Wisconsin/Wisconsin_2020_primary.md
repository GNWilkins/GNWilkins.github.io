Each map has four different data layers:  
 <ul>
  <li>Voting locations for each city on April 7th, 2020</li>
  <li>Census block groups from the most recent American Community Survey 5-year data colored by:
    <ul>
      <li>Population</li>
      <li>Percentage of population that is non-white</li>
      <li>Median household income</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
