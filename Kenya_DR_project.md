## Field Research on Climate Change Perceptions and Impacts in Southern Kenya
### Directed research with the School for Field Studies in Kimana, Kenya
This group research project included field work of house-to-house interviews conducted with the aid of local interpreters (translating from English to Swahili or Kimaasai/Maa).
<br>
We asked about individuals' perceptions of local change, global climate change, various observable indicators, livelihood strategy, adaptation strategies to climate change, and use of new technologies.
<br>
Quantitative results were analyzed using SPSS version 23, and qualitative results were summarized and aggregated to discern relevant trends and common responses.
<br>
Included an individual research paper focused on the local awareness of global climate change and household adaptation strategies.
<br>
Presented our findings and recommendations as a group, alongside information we were able to provide in regards to climate change and future impacts in East Africa to local community members.
