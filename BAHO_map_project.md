## The Bahama Oriole Project
**Fieldwork on Andros, The Bahamas - Summer 2019**
<br><br>
Worked with the Omland Lab (UMBC Biology Department) for 5 weeks with other undergraduates to perform NSF funded research on the critically endangered Bahama Oriole.
<br>
Digitized the logging-road network for use in navigating the field site. Site was used for mist-netting and radio-tracking Bahama Orioles as well as setting camera traps and making observations at randomly selected points.
<br>
Continually updated map as new trails were made or found and new nest sites were discovered.
<br>
Made using QGIS 3.8 (with Bing Satellite).
