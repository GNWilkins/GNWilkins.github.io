## The Bahama Oriole Project
**Fieldwork on Andros, The Bahamas - Summer 2019**
<br><br>
Worked with the Omland Lab (UMBC Biology Department) for 5 weeks with other undergraduates to perform NSF funded research on the critically endangered Bahama Oriole.
Digitized the logging-road network for use in navigating the field site. Site was used for mist-netting and radio-tracking Bahama Orioles as well as setting camera traps and making observations at randomly selected points.
Continually updated map as new trails were made or found and new nest sites were discovered.
